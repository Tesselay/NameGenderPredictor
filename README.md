# NameGenderPredictor

Project a classmate and I did for school. Topic is based on Webscraping (classmate) and machine learning (me).

Description:
A basic application, that uses a trained SVC-Model for predicting the gender of a name, based on meta-data of the name. 
Zip-file includes file with the 'training ground' for the A.I., as well as the menu file and an updated version of the
GridSearch-file I created in my internship at the IAI (https://github.com/Tesselay/IAI-internship). Uses an webscraped
database with data from http://www.behindthename.com/.

To-Do:

    - Use mapping instead of ascii-values and their sums for converting of string-values.
